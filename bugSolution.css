To resolve the layout inconsistency, explicitly define the container's width.  If the container's width should adapt to its contents, use techniques like flexbox or inline-block. 

Here's an example using flexbox:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Fix for padding and border inclusion in width */
}
```

This approach allows the elements to share the available width without overflow issues.  The `box-sizing: border-box` property ensures that padding and border are included within the element's width calculation, preventing unexpected sizing.
