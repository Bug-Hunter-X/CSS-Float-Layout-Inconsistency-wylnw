# CSS Float Layout Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common layout issue encountered when using floating elements in CSS without explicitly defining container width. The problem stems from how different browsers interpret implicit width calculations, causing inconsistent rendering across various environments.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` offers a solution.

## Problem

Using `float: left;` on elements without specifying a container's width can cause unpredictable results.  This is because the browser is left to implicitly compute widths, potentially exceeding the parent's available space.

## Solution

To fix this, explicitly set the width of the parent container. Alternatively, if the container's width should adjust to its contents, use a CSS technique like `display: flex` or `display: inline-block` to effectively manage the floating behavior.
