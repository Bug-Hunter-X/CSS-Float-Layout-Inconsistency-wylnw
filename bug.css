The following CSS rule can lead to unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when multiple `div` elements are placed in a container without specifying the container's width.  Browsers may handle the implicit widths differently, leading to unexpected layout discrepancies or overflow.
